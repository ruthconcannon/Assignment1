            <img src="webdevlop.png" alt="Profile Picture" class="img-fluid rounded-circle" width="150">
            <p>Hi, I'm Ruth, a first-year Interaction Design student at the University of Limerick. I chose to study Interaction Design because I have a passion for creating intuitive and engaging digital experiences. I enjoy problem-solving and finding ways to make technology more accessible and user-friendly.</p>
            <p>I am particularly interested in UX/UI design, web development, and human-computer interaction. I love exploring how design and technology can work together to improve people's everyday lives.</p>
            <p>My goal is to become a UX designer or front-end developer, working on projects that prioritize accessibility and user-centered design. I hope to work on innovative digital experiences that make technology more intuitive for everyone.</p>

            <h2>More About Me</h2>
            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <p>I aspire to work on many projects in the future and fufill my goal of working with some of the most well known tech companies in the world.</p>
            
            <h3>People Who Inspire Me</h3>
            <p>I admire Don Norman, the author of The Design of Everyday Things and a pioneer in human-centered design. His work has shaped how designers think about usability, accessibility, and the user experience..</p>
            
            <h3>Hobbies & Passions</h3>
            <p>My hobbies include soccer and reading, which connect to my career by helping me develop teamwork, strategy, and critical thinking. Soccer enhances my ability to collaborate and adapt in fast-paced environments, skills essential in UX design. Reading expands my knowledge of user psychology, design principles, and emerging technologies, keeping me inspired and informed.</p>
            
            <h3>My Projects</h3>
            <h4>My Leaving Cert Computer Science Project : The Hydro Hub</h4>

    </video>
            <p>The Hydro Hub is a smart device that encourages and tracks water consumption, supporting healthy hydration practices using the BBC micro:bit. Let's break down the main functionalities:.</p>
            <h6>Tracking Water Consumption:</h6>   
            <p>Whenever you tilt the device to the right, it adds one to the waterTrack count.</p>
            <p>It also adds this count to drinkLog.</p>
            <h6>Button A</h6>
            <p>When you press button A, it shows "Sips Taken" on the device screen, followed by the number of sips stored in drinkLog</p>
            <h6>Button B</h6>
            <p>When you press button B, the drinkLog is reset.</p>
            <h6>Drink Log Array:</h6>
            <p>The array ‘drinkLog’ stores the number of times water has been consumed each time the micro:bit is tilted to the right. It is initially an empty array.</p>
            <h6>Serial Output:</h6> 
            <p>The ‘waterTrack’ is continuously output to the serial interface where the data is then stored on graphs in your ‘My Hydro Hub tab'.</p>
            <h6>Continuous Display:</h6>
            <p>It continuously displays a negative icon on the screen unless a sip is being taken, in that case it displays a tick icon until you have finished taken your sip</p>
            <h2>Sound Media Project</h2>
            <P>For this assignment we were asked to: </P>
            <p>Record some audio about a topic, the edit the audio Audacity together with other sounds to form a coherent audio piece. </p>
            <p>For my assignment I recorded audio of me discussing the singer the Weeknd and his rise to fame. I adjusted the volume and added a bass and tremble effect to adjust frequency. I then imported the Weeknd's song as an MP3 to play in the background, and I adjusted the volume such that it enhanced rather than overshadowed my narration. Lastly, to give the background audio a sense of depth and unity between the vocal and musical elements, I subtly applied a reverb effect. </p>

            <h2>Video Media Project</h2>
            <p>This assignment was a group project</p>
            <p>We were asked to work in our groups to record and edit a video on a topic of our choice.</p>
            <p>My group did our project on Artificial Intelligence in acedemia</p>
